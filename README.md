# Lesson-Planner
An automated Lesson Planner, made in python that is crowd sourced by ESL teachers.

This project will be composed of 3 major parts:

    An interface for making a lesson plan.
    An Activity compilers and sorter
    A storage system for common Lesson building blocks.
   
Data_Manip is the program with all the different data entry, sort and write functions. It is vital in making the program last longer and grow with more data.

Main UI program is the program that the user will interact with directly. It has all the different UI elements and allows the user to make changes and select games.

Game Files contains all the different files to help a user create their own game that can go in the database.

Sharepoint_CD is the file that connects to Sharepoint and downloads files from the Activity Finder folder.

Main_Onefile is all the other files combined into one single file so it can be converted into a .exe file.

To-Do List:

    1. Make the .exe file work properly
    2. Create a settings file to future-proof the program.
    4. Add a clipboard function.
