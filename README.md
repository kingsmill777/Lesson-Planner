# Lesson-Planner
An automated Lesson Planner, made in python that is crowd sourced by ESL teachers.

This project will be composed of 3 major parts:
    An interface for making a lesson plan.
    An Activity compilers and sorter
    A storage system for common Lesson building blocks.
   
Data_Input when run will take all Game files and Input them into as CSV files after santizing the inputs. Look at the Sample_game and Guide_game to determine how to make your own game files.

Main UI is the program that will run to get all the relevant data and display in a suitable fashion. To-Do list for it includes integrating the second Combo Box. And incorporating the Data_Input Program.
